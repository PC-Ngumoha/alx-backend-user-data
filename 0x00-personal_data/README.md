# Personal Data (Project)

## Useful Points
- _P.I.I_ stands for _Personally Identifiable Information_ and is a term used to describe any class of information that could be used to reveal an individual's identity, either directly or indirectly. _PII_ as a term is used mostly in the United states. In Europe, and large parts of the world, the term _Personal Data_ is used to denote a similar concept. Although, there are still some minor differences between the two terms.

- Information considered to be _PII_ can be broken into two groups:
  + **Linked Information:** which is more directly linked to the identity of the individual e.g Full name, Home address, login details, cookies, IP and MAC addresses, Device IDs e.t.c.
  + **Linkable Information:** which is not directly linkable to the identity of an individual on it's own but can help such when combined with other pieces of information.

- Unlike _PII_ which tends to lack a standard definition, _Personal Data_ according to the EU's _GDPR_ or _General Data Protection Rules_ is defined as:
  > Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person in this context being defined as one who can be identified directly or indirectly in reference to a standard identifier such as name, identification number, location data e.t.c

- _Logging_ is a better way to display information about the output from our programs. Logging in Python can be implemented through the use of the _logging_ python package. 

- _Logging Levels_ are used to tell the logging mechanism what type of information we wish to display. These levels are as listed below:
  + DEBUG,
  + INFO
  + WARNING
  + ERROR
  + CRITICAL
  By default, the default logging level is set to _WARNING_
